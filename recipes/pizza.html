        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>for 16 servings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups warm water(600 mL)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup semolina flour(30 g)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>“Bloom”</em> the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water.<br> Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li><br>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt.<br> Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture.<br> Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li><br>
            <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes.<br> The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy.<br> Form the dough into a taut round.</li><br>
            <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil.<br> Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li><br>
            <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.<br> Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li><br>
            <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C).<br> Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce:<br> Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.</li><br>
            <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</li><br>
            <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round.<br> Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.</li><br>
            <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it.<br> Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</li><br>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li><br>
            <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li><br>
